Go interfaces define a set of method signatures. Any type that implements those methods satisfies the interfaceâ€”no explicit declaration needed.

```go
type Animal interface {
    Speak() string
}

type Dog struct{}

func (d Dog) Speak() string {
    return "Woof!"
}

```

ðŸ”¹ Kyu chahiye?
Interface allows polymorphism.

It helps in mocking dependencies in tests.

Decouples your code for flexibility.

ðŸ”¹ Pros:
Loosely coupled design.

Easy to mock for testing.

Useful in DI (Dependency Injection).

ðŸ”¹ Cons:
Can make debugging harder (interface wrapping).

No generics before Go 1.18, so often overused.

ðŸ”¹ Industry Use:
Clean architecture â†’ Repositories, Services, etc. use interfaces.

Logging, Storage, APIs, Testing.
