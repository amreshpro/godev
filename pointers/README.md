Pointers store memory address of a variable.

```go
func change(val *int) {
    *val = 100
}
```

ğŸ”¹ Kyu chahiye?
- Pass by reference instead of value.

- Avoid copying large structs.

- Shared mutable state.

ğŸ”¹ Pros:
- Efficient memory usage.

- Useful in performance-critical code.

ğŸ”¹ Cons:
- Pointer misuse = bugs, nil panic.

- Can lead to harder debugging.

ğŸ”¹ Industry Use:
- Working with large data structures (e.g., HTTP request structs).

- Sharing config or state across services.
